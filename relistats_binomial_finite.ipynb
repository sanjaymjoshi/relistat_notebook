By observing a number of successes and failures, we can compute an\n","estimate of reliability. Based on the number of samples, we qualify the quality of this\n","estimate using 'confidence'. Then we can say something like \"Having seen zero failures\n","in 10 samples, we have 80% confidence that the reliability is at least about 85% for the\n","whole population\".
